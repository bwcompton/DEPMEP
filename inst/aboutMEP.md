In 2014, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) 
incorporated the *Massachusetts River and Stream Crossing
Standards* (Crossing Standards) into the Wetlands Protection Act
regulations. The Crossing Standards are now required for all new
permanent crossings of rivers and streams. It was recognized that, in
some cases, it might not be feasible to fully meet those
standards when replacing an existing crossing. As a result, MassDEP
included language in the Regulations stating that replacement crossings
must meet the Crossing Standards "to the maximum extent practicable"
(MEP).

Sometimes it just is not possible to replace a crossing with one that
meets the Crossing Standards, although usually it is not simply a matter
of what's possible, but how much it will cost. Recognizing that the cost
of meeting the Crossing Standards is a major obstacle for implementing
culvert replacement projects, one of the most important considerations
for evaluating Maximum Extent Practicable is the balance between cost
and ecological benefits.

### Baseline cost

Maximum Extent Practicable based on cost is determined by comparing the
cost to fully meet the Crossing Standards against the baseline cost.
Baseline cost is not determined by replacement-in-kind but by the cost
of a crossing design that accommodates the MassDOT Hydraulic Design
Flood for that road classification (Table 1)[^1].

**Table 1. MassDOT Design Floods for Various Road and Highway Functional
Classifications.**

---
| Road or Highway Functional Classification | Hydraulic Design Flood |
| :--- | :--- |
| Interstate, or Limited Access Highways | 100-year flood |
| Rural Principal Arterial | 50-year flood |
| Rural Minor Arterial | 50-year flood |
| Rural Collector, Major | 25-year flood |
| Rural Collector, Minor | 10-year flood |
| Rural Local Road | 10-year flood |
| Urban Principal Arterial | 50-year flood |
| Urban Minor Arterial Street | 25-year flood |
| Urban Collector Street | 10-year flood |
| Urban Local Road | 10-year flood |
| Driveways, Sub-division roads, trails, bike paths, etc. | 10-year flood |

### Cost thresholds

Cost thresholds for exceeding Maximum Extent Practicable are evaluated
against the potential ecological benefits, based on 1) habitat quality
and 2) the increase in aquatic connectivity likely to be achieved by
meeting the Crossing Standards (connectivity restoration potential).

### Habitat quality

For habitat quality, stream segments, and the crossings on those
segments, classified into three classes (highest quality, high quality,
general quality) based on whether they fall into one or more of the
following categories.

- Biomap Aquatic Core
- Cold water fisheries resource
- Diadromous fish run
- Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC)
- Wild and Scenic River

Classes are assigned to stream segments and associated crossings
according to the following.

- **Highest Quality**: two or more of the above categories apply
- **High Quality**: one of the above categories apply
- **General Quality**: All other stream and river segments

### Restoration potential

To assess connectivity restoration potential, we use the most current
Critical Linkages and Coldwater Critical Linkages analyses from the
Landscape Ecology Lab at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

- **Highest Restoration Potential:** Top 5% of statewide Critical
Linkages or top 10% of Coldwater Critical Linkages Effect scores for
crossings on streams with a projected mean summer temperature ≤ 16C

- **Very High Restoration Potential:** 5-10% of statewide Critical
Linkages or top 10-20% of Coldwater Critical Linkages Effect scores
for crossings on streams with a projected mean summer temperature ≤
16C

- **High Restoration Potential:** 10-20% of statewide Critical
Linkages or top 20-30% of Coldwater Critical Linkages Effect scores
for crossings on streams with a projected mean summer temperature ≤
16C

- **Medium Restoration Potential:** 20-25% of statewide Critical
Linkages or top 30-40% of Coldwater Critical Linkages Effect scores
for crossings on streams with a projected mean summer temperature ≤
16C

- **Other:** All other crossings (below top 25% for Critical Linkages;
below top 40% for Coldwater Critical Linkages)

Critical Linkages scores are derived from models and field assessments
of the passibility of road-stream crossings for aquatic organisms. Field
assessments have not been done for all crossings in Massachusetts and
Critical Linkages scores are not available for all crossings.

### Cost factors

Classifications for habitat quality and connectivity restoration
potential are presumed accurate, but may be overcome, to either lower or
raise the classification level of a given crossing, by the presentation
of credible evidence from a competent source.

The proportional cost increases (full compliance cost relative to
baseline cost) for determining what is practicable based on habitat
quality and connectivity restoration potential, are presented in 
Table 2.

<br>
**Table 2. Maximum Extent Practicable Cost Factors**

---
| | Highest Quality | High Quality | General Quality |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | 
| Highest restoration potential&nbsp; | 50% above baseline&nbsp; | 30% above baseline&nbsp; | 25% above baseline |
| Very high restoration potential&nbsp; | 40% above baseline&nbsp; | 25% above baseline&nbsp; | 20% above baseline |
| High restoration potential&nbsp; | 30% above baseline&nbsp; |  20% above baseline&nbsp; | 15% above baseline | 
| Medium restoration potential&nbsp; | 20% above baseline&nbsp; | 15% above baseline&nbsp; | 10% above baseline | 
| Other&nbsp; | 10% above baseline&nbsp; |  10% above baseline&nbsp; | baseline |

When, based on this table, the cost of meeting the Crossing Standards
would make the replacement project impracticable, the Issuing Authority
should consider other design options to maximize aquatic organism
passage with resulting crossing replacement costs up to, but not
exceeding the cost factors listed above. The MEP guidance document
describes various design elements that could be used to mitigate the
barrier effects of road-stream crossings, even when full compliance with
the Crossing Standards is not practicable.
