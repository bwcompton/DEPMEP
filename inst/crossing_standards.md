In 2004, the River and Stream Continuity Partnership released its first
edition of the *Massachusetts River and Stream Crossing Standards*. The
Partnership -- University of Massachusetts Amherst, The Nature
Conservancy, MA Division of Ecological Restoration, and American Rivers
-- developed the Crossing Standards to provide guidance on bridge and
culvert designs that would facilitate the movement of fish and wildlife
across roads and railroads. The Crossing Standards were revised in March
2011 and a minor error was corrected in 2012.

Recognizing that the Crossing Standards were relevant to several of the
"interests" protected by the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act
(WPA), the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection
(MassDEP) in 2014 incorporated the standards into the WPA regulations
(Regulations). The Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act regulations
refer to the General Standards in *Massachusetts River and Stream
Crossing Standards* as the "Crossing Standards."

#### General Standards

1.  Spans (bridges, 3-sided box culverts, open-bottom culverts or
    arches) that preserve the natural stream channel are strongly
    preferred

2.  If a culvert, then it should be embedded:
   - a minimum of 2 feet for all culverts;
   - a minimum of 2 feet and at least 25 percent for round pipe culverts;
   - when embedment material includes elements \> 15 inches in diameter,
     embedment depths should be at least twice the D84 (particle width
     larger than 84% of particles) of the embedment material

3.  Spans channel width (a minimum of 1.2 times the bankfull width)

4.  Natural bottom substrate within the structure

5.  Designed with appropriate bed forms and streambed characteristics so
    that water depths and velocities are comparable to those found in
    the natural channel at a variety of flows

6.  Openness\> 0.82 feet (0.25 meters). Openness is the cross-sectional
    area of a structure opening divided by its crossing length when
    measured in consistent units (e.g. feet).

7.  Banks should be present on each side of the stream matching the
    horizontal profile of the existing stream and banks
